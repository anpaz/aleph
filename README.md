# aleph

`aleph` defines a high level programming model that can be embedded into classical languages to develop large scale quantum hybrid applications, without the quantum mechanics.

It leverages quantum programming principles like *superposition*, *entanglement*, *quantum parallelims* and *amplitude amplification* in a way that is easy to understand and safe to combine with classical computation to enable powerful hybrid applications.

## Getting started

`aleph` is available as a package for both, [F# - aleph.lang](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aleph.lang) and [Python - aleph-lang](https://pypi.org/manage/project/aleph-lang/releases/). Take a look at the documentation of the corresponding packages to get started in that language.

## Building from source

Instructions on how to get your environment setup to build and run `aleph` locally can be found in [src/README.md](src/README.md).
